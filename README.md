# Faenza-NewVanilla

A new vanilla Faenza icon-theme maintened, for users who want a classic vanilla Faenza experience, yet with new icons !

Faenza was one of the slickest uniform icon theme for linux desktops. Sadly, it seems to be unmaintened since a few years, and the Mint-X icon heme use many non-vanilla icons, like their elementary-like icons folder. So, this project aim to maintain the Faenza icon theme, in a vanilla way, by adding new symlink, designing new icons...
